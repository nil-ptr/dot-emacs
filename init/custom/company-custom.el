1. company-math-symbols-unicode and company-math-symbols-latex will
   both be active in org-mode with this setup. However completions
   will go for the unicode variant by default. The latex version only
   activates when the character after point uses a latex-like font. So
   typing \"\\sigm\" will suggest suggest \"Ïƒ\" by default, but will
   suggest \"\\sigma\" if completion is attempted inside something like
   \"\\symbf{}\".

2. company-glsl is installed, but not currently activated, since it
   requires glslValidator to be installed.")
